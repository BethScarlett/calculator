# The Calculator

Welcome to my calculator project! Here you will find a brief run down of how it functions, as well a short description about the project.

## Brief description

This project has been coded in typescript, with SCSS also being utilised to style the calculator on the webpage. The typescript uses event listeners tied to the onscreen buttons to either get a number or perform a mathmatical operation, depending on what button has been clicked.

## How to operate

You are able to select a number, an operator and then another number. These numbers can be any length and can include a point using point button, located at the bottom of the button field. At this point you can select equals or another operator (with the exception of +/-, . and C), and the calculation will be performed. This allows for any length of equation to be inputted by the user.

If you wish to start a new equation, you can either press the clear (C) button, or by selecting = and beginnning to input new numbers to start another sequence.
